# Decision Review System

In this project, you are the the third umpire and decide whether a batter is out or not out. 
We majorly use Tkinter library of Python for creating the GUI application.


## Description

The way this project works is, a user clicks on the play button in the application(code for which is given in repo) and a video is played. 
There are various options such as forward and back both in fast and slow motion available.
The user after watching the clip in desired speed multiple times decides if the batter is out or not out.
The user then displays the decision on screen by clicking the appropriate button(out/not out).
